# QRE-LMS
The repository contains the code for the Quadratic Relative Error - Least Mean Squares (QRE-LMS) Filter, which minimises the relative error between the actual signal and the estimated signal (in the mean).
There are also codes containing the conventional LMS, Normalised LMS (NLMS), and the Error Normalised LMS (ENLMS), to compare the results with the QRE-LMS filter. 
# Data Sets
Two datasets are used for the comparison: 
1. A speech signal
2. An EEG signal (was also tested with an ECG signal)
3. Synthetic signals (sine wave)
